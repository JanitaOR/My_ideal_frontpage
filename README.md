  vw "viewport width" 10vw = 10% of the viewport width (browser window). 

  I have used it to make the title responsive.

  calc() calculates values with operators + - * / surrounded by whitespace(1 + 1, not 1+1), most importent with whitespace between + and -.

  In my case px * vw(% of the viewport).
